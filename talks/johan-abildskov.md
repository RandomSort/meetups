## About Talk

**Meetup Group**: DevOps MalmÃ¶

**Date**: Tuesday, 9 March 2021

**Topic:** Automation is Hard! .. And we're doing it wrong.

**Abstract:**<br/>

We spend a lot of energy and time on automation, yet often we struggle to reap the benefits. Automation is one of the pillars of DevOps. Automation is also difficult and often approached in a bad way. 

Automation is touted as the magic bullet to productivity. No matter if we talk infrastructure, testing, deployment or traceability. Many projects that start an automation effort in search of the silver bullet, will however spend a lot of effort in automation with low return on investment.

This talk will cover how we go wrong in our automation efforts and some tips and tricks for moving in the right direction with the right mindset.


**Bio:**<br/>

I am a Continuous Delivery and DevOps consultant and teacher. I did not write the book on DevOps, but I did write the song for DevOpsDays Copenhagen. I help companies both with process and culture, but I do enjoy it when I can dive into the deep tech stuff. I am particular fond of Git, Jenkins, Artifactory and Gradle as a toolstack.

I maintain [Opinionated Git](http://opinionatedgit.com), and the [best darn Git exercises around](https://github.com/eficode-training/git-katas). I enjoy programming, music, gaming and being with my family of course ðŸ™‚.

I also wrote a [book on Git](https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484262696)
